# Battery_Charging_Discharging_Simulation
Simulink Project for Battery Charging and Discharging Analysis
# Battery Charging and Discharging Simulation

## Project Description
This Simulink project demonstrates the charging and discharging behavior of a battery using a constant current source. The model includes:
- A battery block
- A constant current source
- A bus selector to output State of Charge (SOC), Voltage, and Current to a scope.

## Features
- Simulates battery charging and discharging cycles
- Monitors SOC, Voltage, and Current in real-time
- Uses a bus selector to extract and display relevant parameters

## Files Included
- `Battery_Charging_Discharging.slx`: The Simulink model file
- `README.md`: Project description and details
- Optional: Additional documentation in the `docs` folder

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Battery_Charging_Discharging.slx` in MATLAB Simulink.
3. Run the simulation and observe the SOC, Voltage, and Current outputs on the scope.
